Overview

The purpose of this project is to develop a classic Snake Game using Python and the Turtle module. 
This project helps improve game development skills, including handling user input, implementing game logic, and managing object movements on the screen. 
The game is interactive, requiring players to control a snake to eat food and grow while avoiding collisions with the walls or itself.

How to Play

Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.

The goal is to eat the green food to grow in size and increase your score.

Avoid colliding with the edges of the screen or with yourself.

The game continues until the player crashes, at which point they must restart.

Purpose

This project was created to enhance understanding of game development principles, including event handling, animation, and logic implementation in Python. 
It also serves as a practical example of object-oriented programming (OOP) and user interaction within a graphical environment.
